Peace... be at peace. 

It is a chilly morning this day, and we are planning on going to the Legion of Honor museum complex where The Thinker is kept.

We are also going to visit the Palace of Fine Art. Wow!

Yesterday, 05/23/ (year of our Lord) 2025 we did the following:

11am breakfast leftover korean pancakes;

### Above: The Reward
