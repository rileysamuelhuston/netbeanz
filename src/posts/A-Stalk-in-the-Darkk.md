Today I went for a walk in the partk. I grabbed my bike and helmet and my bag and camera - with a simple goal to go outside and write a bit on my laptop. For this website - Netbeanz.com.

An hour before I had arrived home by bike. So dark it was! I remember on the way home thinking about how lucky I was to have lights. Perhaps one of the last lines of defense for leg-powered bikers, but that's neither here nor there. 

I said "happy birthday" and "hello" to my roommate Thomas when he arrived. I had been excited to go to Vine night - a night of brews and bros - at a bar called Fourth Street Vine...

But there was no celebration! No birthday or brews or gregorious bros. Instead, there was Thomas alone entering the three-person house-style apartment managed by Borba Property group. He glanced my way, and as he did I said "There's the birthday boy," (In a goofy, light tone mind you), and "Hello."

I consulted Thomas about any news he had heard about the upcoming festivities at Vine, and asked him if we were still on for tonight. He said "No." I asked, "Do you wanna go anyway?" He moves from the door to the kitchen to the living room, turning to leave, face framed by the pseudo arch created by the structural outer walls of the upper unit, grafted-on top of our house unit along with two other back units that include inhabitants such as: Joseph, the Egypian Family, The Cal Trans employees, and a family of four. unit above, he says, "Nah, I'm good. It's okay."

Thomas is my Roomate. He's a funny dude - definitely down to hang out, dance, or party if the respective occastions ever arrive. (Sometimes they arrive at the same time. Sometimes they overlap.) He recently lost his guinea pig named Nia (with an "N"). She was very cute, and I had the privelage of petting her after I first arrived in Long Beach. She's a bundle and heftier than you think, and of course very, very cute.

He buried her in the front yard one day. With spoon from the kitchen, chipping away at the top layer of the lawn's tough sun-baked dirt. He buried her in a shoebox. I never saw the embalming ceremony, but I did witness the burial. It was dark, so I held up my phone's flashlight.

Thomas, covered in dirt, arose from the site, after having just levered a slab-like slat-like garden stone over Nia to cover her body. And protect it from Racoons and Coyotes. And he went inside, and smoked.
