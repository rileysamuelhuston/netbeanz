Hey guys! Welcome back to another humor exploration - I’m going to show you some puns I came up with over the long weekend (thank upper management for that, they approved my request this time!)

Usually shelly is so “by the books” she barely approves my bathroom slips and I have to hold it, sometimes for days at a time. When I have beef stroganoff at lunch - (which Steven hates but I CRAVEs, his lunch bag is next to mine and one time we traded lunches. He had turkey breast and a sleeve of Saltines and hummus (roasted garlic, tahini) - I have these massive shiitake mushroom sharts that I have to blast into my cloth (diaper that is) and rinse out in the morn’ when the crows knock. Takes a few extra mins but ‘sall good to moi. That’s french not my stench.

The rec. Volleyball league has been going AWESOME, however.. Dave’s a great coach and he says we might just clinch the title this year and get the coveted office waffle party - Michael’s ankle is still twisted up good though so we’ll see we’ll see… yesterday (today’s wednesday yeah yeah no wednesday is today so yesterday TUESDAY yah, at practice tuesday yesterday Troy comes up to me, he’s always like this, troy asks if I was a lame-o-crat or MAGA-publican (hoping to get a rise out of our politically active but very old coworker Ms. Bartholomew) I told with a straight fuckin face that I am neither a registered republican nor registered democrat but a registered BADASS - he lost his SHIT no pun intended hahahaha hahahahahah he drives a toyota yaris…

> Turns on cam. Security this time from an outlet or charger catches him going to computer - switch to amazon apple cam - cam inside apple pov takes a bite -They got cams all over the frickin’ room and at this present moment, I’m literally defcon 0.5 that’s how unsurprised I am.
