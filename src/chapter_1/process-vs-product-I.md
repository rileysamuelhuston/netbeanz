I see here... what the heck is it OH yeah some fuggin' sketches or some shiss? Probz of an idea I had just two or three years ago... I am Q and here's a drop in the hat for you: there gonna start giving free land to the first and third customers of local Quizno's subs. Local Quizno's as part of an ongoing "Q-Anon of the Summer" campaign are giving away free land to the first and third enjoyers of a hot italian or sandwich of equal or lesser value. Get your free land "Q"-day, while supplies last. God ain't makin' more dirt. 

Over the X-Mas break I watched this movie “Perfect Days” by Wim Wenders on [Yesmovies.mn](https://yesmovies.mn). Perfect Days is a movie about feeling content, and Wim Wenders just so happens to share a pair of initials with a certian other "W.W." but I won't get too into it because I'm not trying to get political here. Breaking Bad is a great show. People say "Eff you, Skylar!" but I think she was doing her best. She shouldn't have smoked with that baby in her tummy though that was TOO far. I also saw another movie last year called ”Whiplash” Whiplash! Muthafuckin' it's the dub to the -iplash with Cave Johnson starring. Both stories follow the lives and livelihoods of their protagonists. The main characters pictured thus:


Hirayama, a Public toilet cleaner in Tokyo’s upscale Shibuya district, and
Andrew Neiman, an ambitious young drummer at the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory in New York City. Neiman is Hirayama in a backwards broken mirror.

Hirayama, stedfast and stalwart against the siren song of a better life, job, or “greater purpose” is at peace with himself entire... and in love with life and all of its horrible, non-YouTube-short content-generating 5G-less parts.

(note to author: include pix of him taking photos, looking @ trees, smiling and helping others). All the qualities that lead to lasting happiness according to studies, I bet.

I really want to be like Hirayama! So at peace. I was jealous of his contentment! “I wish I was that humble/content” is what i'm saying, basically. And the funniest part is that I also wanted to be Andrew Neiman of Whiplash.

Seeing whiplash I felt like I was living out, or going to live out, the plot of the frickin' movie. I <i>related</i> to Andrew and his <i>unshakable</i> foolish quest to <i>succeed</i>. I was thrilled by the end: Andrew does succeed and becomes what he set out to shissing become. At least in my interpretation. But this is the exact opposite of what the movie is about. (Dad’s look of horror is not awe.) (Director quote about sad ending). I’m now paraphrasing a great video — What do you think?on the dissonance between those two reactions.

I think that Whiplash has a great and valuable lesson to teach about greatness. Those who are great do not give up in the end, even if they do give up in the moment. It's the long run that really matters. If Andrew had given up after his car crash then he would have been just Andrew, and that would have been fine.

Or maybe the real lesson is that "greatness" isn't actually real. That a path to "greatness" is actually a fake and false path. By choosing to follow some sort of path you actually avoid any real threads of greatness.
