### Process Vs. Product: Whiplash vs Perfect Days and a Comparison of my Reactions Thereof

![Alt text](/images/pvp.jpg "Kitchen at E 6th St Long Beach")

I see here a desire to do great work. But in the effort I see also an ego that prevents the flow of ideas—great ones—from ever starting. This page now represents to me a sad feeling of regret—which is the incorrect response anyway. Regret over what, exactly? Not coming to a conclusion that would take me nearly three years to come to on my own? I should not feel regret. And even in that when I say “should” it implies some inward-facing external pressure to adhere to an expected track… But what I mean is that regret is unhelpful to me now. It does not give me new information. Now I feel improvement mixed with a bit of amusement over the work and attitude I had toward these projects when I was doing them. I set out with a goal with all my creative projects—I feel the initial drive to dive is driven in part by the invented ideas or goals I created or projects I thought of before convincing myself to take the dive. And in my invented fantasies these invented ideas convinced me that I could do something new or do more, or that what I had and what I was doing wasn't enough, and that I needed something else. This was manufactured boredom. The specter of disinterested disheart—and the pure feeling of ambition in the egotistical sense—is what drives the beginning of new creative hobbies… or it used to!

What I am practising now is a new exploration into mindful contentment and a resistance also to the ongoing cycle of consumption that so easily feeds this greed for greatness. All those whose creative endeavors I admire have a true love of process over product.

Process over product is without a doubt the only way for me to sustainably do… anything. I am not the only one to say this. Love of the game is what keeps you going.

I saw this movie “Perfect Days” by Wim Wenders. Mr. W. W. himself. It is a movie about feeling content. I also saw another movie last year—”Whiplash” by (do I even put the director? It’s Whiplash, and it stands as a work.) Both stories follow the lives and livelihoods of their protagonists. The main characters:

Hirayama, a Public toilet cleaner in Tokyo’s upscale Shibuya district, and
Andrew Neiman, an ambitious young drummer at the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory in New York City.

These two characters represent, to me, the idea of process over product -- both in their behaviors, desires, and personalities. They are the perfect examples of their respective ideas.

Hirayama, unfazed and untempted by the pull of a better job or some “greater purpose” is someone at peace and in love with life and all of its imperfections (takes photos, looks @ trees, smiles and helps others). All the qualities that lead to lasting happiness… What I found most interesting in my thinking about this story besides how good of a movie it was, was my initial reaction, which was that I really wanted to be like Hirayama! So at peace. The ultimate irony is that I was jealous of his contentment! Basically saying “I wish I was that humble/content.”

My reaction to Whiplash was the opposite—and that is scary to me now. It gave me a revelation: seeing whiplash I felt like I was living out, or going to live out, the movie. I related to Andrew and his unshakable foolish quest to succeed—and was thrilled by the end, asn in my interpretation, Andrew succeeds and becomes what he set out to become. But no! This is the exact opposite of what the movie is about. (Dad’s look of horror is not awe.) (Director quote about sad ending). I’m now paraphrasing a great video — What do you think?on the dissonance between those two reactions.
