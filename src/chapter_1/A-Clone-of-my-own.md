### A Clone of My Own

<center>This is only the beginning.</center>
<br>

Welcome to my website - now with a “mute” button. I am finally happy to announce the creation of Netbeanz.com. This website is a small project I began midway through January of 2025.

This site comprises one of three ways that I present myself online, and the other two are somewhere to be found on google.com or Instagram.

I'd like to expand my presence, though, across the internet... eventually into three neighboring sites that cover my writing, projects, and travels (Netbeanz); my photography; and my design work. (I <3 grammar.)

But for right now, I think netbeanz.com alone is more than enough.

There are a couple of secrets on the site, one to be exact. Let's see if you can discover it before time runs out!
