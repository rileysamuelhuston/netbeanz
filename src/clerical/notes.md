<li>En France Un voyage (pendant juin 24 - juillet 6) Day 1 ‚Äî Today we arrived in Paris, and immediately hopped in he TGV after the 9hr flight. We then went to AvIgnon. Of course, I dropped my trumpet, and now I have to go to an instrument repair shop. We had dinner. It was strange egg deals as the appetizer, and turkey-sort-of-ham-looking meat for the main course. We had an ice cream cake sort of thing. Day 2 ‚Äî Our first breakfast in France. We then took a bus to Arles to see the colosseum area and church deal. We had lunch too. I had a caprese sort of sandwich. We then went to Les Baux-de-Provence and had dinner there after spending time walking around. I took a shower today. Day 3 ‚Äî Today we went to Avignon to see le palais des papes. It was cool. There was a sort of ‚Äúguided‚Äù tour with tablets, and I won a prize after collecting these coins hidden in various rooms in the palace. We ate lunch there, then went to saintes Marie de la mer for the beach and dinner. That‚Äôs basically it. I took a shower today. Day 4 ‚Äî Today we had breakfast before packing and driving to Aix de Provence. We could not decide on a place to eat, but I had a kebab. We stand out as tourists. I don‚Äôt though, that much, because the people speak to me in French until the other people talk and order... burgers. We then went to Cannes and Nice. Day 5 ‚Äî Nous sommes all√©s √† la plage le matin hier. Il a fait beau, mais je ne me suis pas baign√©, mais les autres gens se sont baign√©s. Apr√®s √ßa, nous sommes all√©s √† la parfumerie et j‚Äôai achet√© quatre savons. Ils sont les petits canards jeunes. Puis, Tristan (Evan), Antoine (Miles), et moi sommes all√©s au restaurant pour le d√©jeuner. J‚Äôavais un sandwich. Il √©tait une baguette avec du jambon, du beurre, et du fromage. Alors, il a plu (beaucoup et tr√®s forte). Nous sommes rentr√©s √† l‚Äôautocar plus tard. Day 6 ‚Äî Today, we spent about 5 hours in the TGV to Paris. I still haven‚Äôt fixed my trumpet, but it will be ok. After arriving in Paris, the main LW group and the other group split. I don‚Äôt like the other group, and I‚Äôm glad they split from us. Their teachers are bad at French (they speak with American accents), and I have yet to hear a single one of the students speak French. It‚Äôs bad. I met my family and we went to the house. They have a nice house in a town called Herblay. Everyone is nice, but the bedroom is a bit warm. It smells like grandma Carole‚Äôs house here. Day 7 ‚Äî Today, we went to the cathedral at Chartres. Before that, though, I ate lunch with the mom and Romain and Titouan. I had a steak with salad and fries, but the meat was pretty much raw! I didn‚Äôt eat all of it. I think that I am a person who wants to prove himself to others. But if someone has good qualities, then they will shine through on their own. Day 8 (July 1) ‚Äî Today, I hung out with my host family. I played ps4 with Romain and Titroan. In the afternoon, we went for ice cream by the Seine. It was nice. I had a peach sorbet with some other type of ice cream. We walked in this old raised road and it was nice. We were going to go biking, but it got too late. When the parents talk to me in English, I feel like they don‚Äôt think I can speak French very well, but I know that that is not true. Day 9 ‚Äî Today, I got up at 8 so we could take the 9:27 train to Paris. I got a subway card also. We went first to the Paris opera house. It was beautiful and cool. Next, we went to the mus√©e gr√©vin. It was a wax museum, and I saw Nicolas Cage and Michael Jackson. It was a little weird how real the statues were. I had lunch at Starbucks. After we took the metro to champs √âlys√©e. We saw the presidents house (or the fence surrounding it), and I took an illegal photograph of one of the gates. One of the guards stopped me and said I had to delete it. After that we saw the louvre and I almost fell asleep on the train home. I think I‚Äôm getting better at French, which is good. Day 10 ‚Äî Today we went to Monte Marte. It was nice and there were a lot of painters. I bought a painting of the Eiffel Tower, and it was much cheaper than other paintings at only ‚Ç¨15, compared to ‚Ç¨30+. Next, Romain and I went to les invalides. We saw the WWI and WWII museums with cool exhibits of the old weapons. Apparently, the next Olympic Games will be in Paris, so the whole city is in restoration mode to make it good for the games. We weren‚Äôt able to go to notre dame, unfortunately, because it was too difficult, but I will go with Mme. Kern probably, so that‚Äôs good. Day 12 ‚Äî Today was the last day with my home stay. I got up as usual, then we took the train o St. Lazare station and took the subway to the catacombs. There we waited in the hot sun for about three hours (yes, three). The catacombs were cool, and filled with skulls and bones. It didn‚Äôt smell bad. After that, we went home after going to McDonald‚Äôs. I had water, Romain had a McFlurry. We went home and had dinner. I said thanks to everyone and we took pictures and I gave the gifts and then I said goodnight and then I took a shower and then I brushed my teeth and then I went to bed now. It‚Äôs late. Day 12 ‚Äî Today, I got my bags and went with Romain and his mom Valerie to the train. Romains mom gave me a chocolate croissant (pain au chocolat) and macarons as a gift. We took the metro to the hotel, and I met up with my group. After that, the group took the subway (metro) to the champs √âlys√©e. I had already been, so the arc de triumph wasn‚Äôt as triumphant as my previous visit, but glances would illicit a reaction of joy and wonder. We then went on a guided tour of the louvre. We saw the Mona Lisa. It was small. We returned to the hotel after going to Monoprix. I purchased two peaches and a water bottle. After that, and a short hiatus, we went out to eat. I had a bad and expensive Cobb salad. Even if I wear boring clothes day after day, I don‚Äôt need vibrant attire to supplement my personality. Day 13 ‚Äî Our last day en France. Crazy. I‚Äôm kinda happy that we‚Äôre going home, though. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, my experience in France taught me a lot about who I am as a person and about France and the culture of course... We woke up early and went to the metro. There, we took the train to les invalides. I saw Napoleon‚Äôs tomb for the deuxi√®me fois, but this time I went to the bottom level. After that, me and a few others (Bella, Feli, Lili, and Mme. Kern) went to a short, afternoon mass at Notre Dame. We got to skip the line. The mass was short and I didn‚Äôt really know what to do, so I just followed what everyone else was doing. I didn‚Äôt take communion. After that we had lunch and there was a cool CD/book store. We then went back to the hotel for a couple of hours before heading for the Eiffel tour. When we go to the tower via metro, I realized, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm actually in France, and the Eiffel Tower is huge! We had a wonderful dinner. First course was a carrot stew. It was good. Also, there was this orange-grapefruit juice that was sharp but sweet. The main dish was chicken. It was very good, and it had this garlic-y foam on top with mashed potatoes underneath. For the final course, there was this chocolate cake. It sat atop a crunchy pastry perch. What a good day. I‚Äôm tired, ready to go home but sad that the trip has to end. I won‚Äôt soon forget this experience (especially because I wrote down what we did each day!). Fin.</li>

<li>Merriam-Webster‚Äôs Word of the Day (February 2, 2019): portend ‚Ä¢ \por-TEND\ ‚Ä¢ verb ‚Äî 1: to give an omen or anticipatory sign of, 2: indicate, signify ‚Äî The old saying about a halo around the moon portending rain has some truth to it: the halo is caused by cirrus clouds drifting 20,000 feet or more above the Earth, and high cirrus clouds often precede stormy weather. ‚Äî "To most people, a shore gas station carrying sushi was but a footnote. But Chris could see that that addition portended a changing demographic." ‚Äî Rona Kobell, quoted in The Baltimore Sun, 8 Nov. 2018 ‚Äî Did you know? Portend has been used in English in the context of signs of things to come since the 15th century. The word derives from the Latin verb portendere, which means "to predict or foretell." That verb, in turn, developed as a combination of the prefix por- (meaning "forward") and the verb tendere (meaning "to stretch"). So you can think of portend as having a literal meaning of "stretching forward to predict." Additional descendants of tendere include extend, tendon, and tension, among others.</li>
