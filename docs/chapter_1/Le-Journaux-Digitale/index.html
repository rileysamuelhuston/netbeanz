<h3>Le Journaux Digitale</h3>

<br>
<br>
<p>I finally found why I like that I find it weird in Long Beach.</p>
<p>I had the realization as I was taking out the trash tonight that I like how much I like how weird Long Beach is. As I was doing my garbage curls (10 reps per arm!) I took a sec for the first time in, like, 5 months. Cause normally I’d be watching 60-second increments of Breaking Bad on my phone on YouTube Shorts. They upload the whole show in clips to the site, and then it’ll show up on my phone—like on my phone—and I can watch it with or without sound because they put the subtitles nice and big on there. And sometimes they’ll have people talk over it to say who each guy is or what each guy does. And it’s really a great way to do it because it only takes 60 seconds MAX per clip, so I can mow through like a hundred in a sitting or if I’m on the toilet. I’ve seen about a dozen movies this year through YouTube Shorts alone and there’s no sign of it stopping now. Such is life of a new dawn.</p>
<p>At first I thought Long Beach was super weird. Like just plain weird—the gates, the concrete, the sidewalks and benches. Ok? Plain weird. More like Medium weird I guess … I actually find the intimidating OVERPASSES of OVERPASSES comforting, like huge golden arches (“I’m Lovin’ It”) beckoning me towards the inland empire. There’s something quite haunting about how much industry there is here staring you right in the frickin’ face man. As far as the eye can see—consumed by it—like it’s wrapping up on all sides, always in your periphery just enough to make you blind. YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH.</p>
<p>AHHHHH ok the fact of the matter is the following: WOW… this guy WRITES A LOT. Ok? A-LOT.</p>
<p>Ok I kinda scared myself with the crazy thought I just had… I for real thought I was going insane. This is insane. What am I doing right now. Snap out of it bro—I can’t stop—I can’t stop writing about how I’m feeling it’s literally like black mirror—It’s literally like I’m drugged up and writing at supersonic speeds bruh like Eminem (Chocolate Candies).</p>
<p>M&amp;M’s logo can be spelled out phonetically in writing as (consulting a <a href="https://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/ipa-sounds/ipa-chart-with-sounds/#ipachartstart">phonemic chart</a>): “A capital ‘em’ (/m/) followed by the character ‘ampersand’ (&amp;) followed by another capital ‘em,’ (/m/) and then an apostrophe and an ‘ess.’ (/s/)”</p>
<p>But their slogan, however, is more interesting — it reads, “Melts in your mouth not in your hands” [sic].</p>
<p>The drama of yesteryear seems so silly in comparison to that which you can experience today.</p>
<p>Now I am typing on my keyboard that I got from online. I finally got it paired and now I’m using it to write this journal entry into a nice little microscopic bow because I need to go to bed. So goodnight, sayonara, and have a great day tomorrow bro and crush monday. Monday won’t know what hit it bro I’m lucky to work bro potatoes and eggs bro 2fo seven bro … ok bro. Yea.</p>

<p>Long discussion at work about the validity of the painted “hammer” finish on trash cans.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammer_paint">Hammer Finish</a></p>
<p>The paint, as my opinion personally stands now as a mammalian nurturable, is that it’s great! Looks super cool and is very durable.</p>
