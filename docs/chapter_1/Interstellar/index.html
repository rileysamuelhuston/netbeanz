<h3>Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night</h3>
<center>Written by Dylan Thomas</center>
<br>
<br>
<p>Do not go gentle into that good night,<br>
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
<p>Though wise men at their end know dark is right,<br>
Because their words had forked no lightning they<br>
Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>
<p>Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright<br>
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,<br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
<p>Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,<br>
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,<br>
Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>
<p>Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight<br>
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,<br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
<p>And you, my father, there on the sad height,<br>
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.<br>
Do not go gentle into that good night.<br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
