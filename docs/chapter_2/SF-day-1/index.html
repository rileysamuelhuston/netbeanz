<h3>Welcome to San Francisco, The City that Never Squeaks</h3>
<center>The First Day</center>

<p>A beautiful good morning.</p>
<p>Just finished the first night’s sleep in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>Yesterday I flew into SF around 11 and met up with daniel at l’aeroport. I had to check my bag because I forgot I had my pocket knife on the keychain carabiner I keep with me. Dang it! With Southwest Airlines, though, it’s free to check up to two bags.</p>
<p>I woke up around 4am to catch a 5am Uber for my 7am flight, and with that schedule I had plenty of time to shower, remember things I forgot to pack, make some coffee, go through security twice, and even read a petite bit of my book.</p>
<img src="/images/sf1-29.webp" alt="">
<p>The flights were great and I made two origami cranes. I sat next to a nice lady on the second flight but didn’t get her name. Actually, I sat next to two women. One was from Houston the other from SF. The second woman’s daughter is dancing in the carnival celebration this Sunday, 5/25.</p>
<p>I arrived in SFO, waited a bit for my bag, and met up with Dan. There are so many AI billboards in sf. This is really the tech hub of the world.</p>
<p>Next to the airport are all the gene research centers, too.</p>
<p>We drove to the Mission district to get some lunch. I brought a bunch of cameras and was very excited to try out my new film cam - I had ordered a bunch of film to Dan's apt.</p>
<p>The drive to the mission district was crazy with the geography of SF - so many hills, reveals, and views. It’s dramatic! And the buildings are short. The classic SF townhome is so ornamented. I had fun looking around at all the insane details that people of yore took the time to add to these homes in the molding, carving, and gold-leafing. Many, many colors. So stimulating to look at.</p>
<p>We ate lunch at Senor Sisig in the Mission District. We each got perfectly cylindrical burritos flavored to perfection - the restaurant started as a food truck before opening brick and mortar corner stores all over the city. Apparently San Francisco doesn’t really have any fast food, so most all of the restaurants are just regular restaurants?!</p>
<p>After the burritos Dan took us to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Dolores_Park">Mission Dolores Park</a> for a splendid view of the city. Absolutely splendid. He asked if I had seen <i>The Brutalist</i>, and I said, “No, I haven’t seen <em><i>The Brutalist</i></em>,” and he said, “Oh you should see <i>The Brutalist</i>.”</p>

<p>We also did the following that I will have to update later:</p>
<ul>
<li>Went to Fieldwork coffee shop, quaintly situated in an adapted and reused public restroom</li>
<li>Played Pong at a pinball arcade</li>
</ul>
