<h3>Dan and I went to the SF MOMA on 5/25, which is the day that these events transpired.</h3>
<p>Welcome to the end of the trip. We spent most of our time today in the SF MOMA, which was awesome. We both made sketches of the pieces in the Ruth Asawa special exhibition. It was a mega walkthrough of her whole career. We spent the majority of our time in this part of the museum.</p>
<img class="portrait-image" src="/images/sf4-19.webp" alt="sf4-19.webp" title="sf4-19.webp">
<p>( ò Õü ñ  ò) Got coffee in the morning (‚òÖ‚Äø‚òÖ) Hopped on bay wheels ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) Arrived at SF MOMA</p>
<p>üëå Saw Ruth Asawa exhibition, which was very cool and spanned her entire career.</p>
<img class="square-image" src="/images/sf4-0.webp" alt="sf4-0.webp" title="sf4-0.webp">
<p>Her wire sculptures are really something. She made so many of them. There were some great examples of her explorations too, and some of them were in 2D, like these that she did in halftone sheets:</p>
<img class="square-image" src="/images/sf4-2.webp" alt="sf4-2.webp" title="sf4-2.webp">
<p>It was a multi-room event. They were even showing the doors that she had carved for her San Francisco home! Crazy. Big doors - I wish a took a pic but I didn't.</p>
<img class="square-image" src="/images/sf4-3.webp" alt="sf4-3.webp" title="sf4-3.webp">
<p>It was around this time that the film I had in my camera got very stuck. I think the part that was hanging on to the inside of the film canister ripped off, so the film just spun around the winding side of the camera when I went to crank the shutter winder. I switched to my phone and started taking these vertical panorama photos instead. As Dan said, the film camera is a limitation for creative purposes, and now I return to the device that has it all, but with a new set of limitations and creative idears.</p>

<div class="right-column">
<p>Remember what I said about the camera? Yeah... that didn't actually happen. <span class="spoiler">Turns out I didn't even have any film loaded AT ALL.</span></p>
<h3>We also did the following:</h3>
<p>(‚óè'‚ó°'‚óè) Checked out the Cafe and ate some pastries</p>
<p>(‚ìø_‚ìø) Saw an awesome exhibition on photography. Lots of famous photographs and really great ideas pictured within. Inspiring to me as I take photos for this site.</p>
<p>‚îè („Çúœâ„Çú)=‚òû Went through the Olafur Eliasson tunnel</p>
<img class="portrait-image" src="/images/sf4-6.webp" alt="sf4-6.webp" title="sf4-6.webp">
<p>(o'‚îè‚ñΩ‚îì'o) Muesum closed at 5:00pm, so we hit the shop. I got a bunch of good loot that I will upload here later.</p>
<p>¬Ø\<em>(„ÉÑ)</em>/¬Ø We walked to the bus to get back to Dan's area.</p>
