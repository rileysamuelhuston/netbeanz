    <h3>Perfect Days vs. Whiplash and A Short Introspective Thereon</h3>

<p>I see here... what the heck is it OH yeah some sketches or some shiss? Probz of an idea I had just two or three years ago...</p>
<p>Over the X-Mas break I watched this movie “Perfect Days” by Wim Wenders on <a href="https://yesmovies.mn">Yesmovies.mn</a>. Perfect Days is a movie about feeling content (Wim Wenders just so happens to share a pair of initials with a certian other “W.W.”) I saw another movie last year called ”Whiplash” Whiplash! Muthafuckin’ it’'s the dub to the -iplash with Cave Johnson starring of <i>Portal 2</i> fame. Both stories follow the lives and livelihoods of their protagonists. Shocker!
Hirayama, a Public toilet cleaner in Tokyo’s upscale Shibuya district, and Andrew Neiman, an ambitious young drummer at the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory in New York City. Neiman is sort of similar to Hirayama if Neiman and Hirayama were looking into a backwards broken mirror and were also blind and deaf.</p>

Hirayama, stedfast and stalwart against the siren song of a better life, job, or “greater purpose” is at peace with himself entire... and in love with life and all of its horrible, non-YouTube-short content-generating 5G-less parts.</p>

<p>Ohh, gods below! I really want to be like Hirayama. So at peace. Jealous of his contentment I thought, “I wish I were as humble/content as he.” How ironic is that? At the same time, though, I also wanted to be Andrew Neiman of <i>Whiplash</i>. I even felt like I was living out, or going to live out, the plot of the movie through my job, future schooling endeavors, or both. I related to Andrew and his foolish quest to achieve a measure of greatness, thus I was thrilled by the end of the movie: Andrew does succeed and becomes what he set out to shissing become. I later leanerd that the director intended Andrew's story to be more like an Icarus allegory... oh crap.</p>
<p>It is growth, ya know. Especially now as the future is uncertain (writing in the Winter and Spring of 2025...) I am okay with good enough, hah.</p>
<p><img src="/images/whiplash-horror.gif" alt="Alt text" title="Whiplash 45:18–45:27"></p>
<p>I think that Whiplash has a great and valuable lesson to teach about greatness. And in the same frame that the movie warns of the perfectionism trap it also shows real dedication and perserverance. I'm not sure, a lot of skilled people have poured their heart of hearts into their work and done better for it, but also, as in the case of Virgil Abloh, have flown too close to the sun and returned their body's water to the ooze from whence they crawled. Greatness is great but &quot;good enough&quot; is peace.
Instead of greatness try these four alternatives instead. Have fun, that's number one. Or try something new.</p>
<p>The real lesson is that “greatness” is not a possible reality but a trap in the form of a negative self-eating Oro Boros. In the third book of the <i>Dune</i> series by Frank Herbert, <i>Children of Dune</i> the emperor-to-be Leto II conqueres the millions of years of inner lives that he unlocked while still in the womb of his mother. Crazy, right? He can see the future, basically, and visualizes them as threads from some infinitely big ball of yarn. The paradox is thus: by choosing to follow some sort of path you snip all others. What am I trying to say here? and snip any possible future in which you enjoy yourself for even a second. Take things as they come, extract knowledge as you may, and enjoy yourself as you complete the process. Strive for satisfaction not perfection, that is my new motto. This quote from Dune, the first Law of Mentat, speaks to this idea and to the idea of perfectionism, which is a different but not-too-terribly-unrelated topic!</p>
