    <p>What's up internet! It's your boy Chris double-X from the interwebs comin' at you with another hair brained scheme. Chris Angel, if you're reading this: I’m here for you. I’ve got some new ideas for you to try, like some crazy stunts and whatnot? Just hit me up man I’ve got some great material. I’ll give you some for free right now - ok comin’ at you here is a transparent coffin prank. You get some guy to go to the funeral, switch the coffin - which you are in - for one with a guy in it and the coffin is also transparent. Gonna see you in there and shit? Yeah that’s smart, safe, and so funny! And it would be funny if you started throwing cards and shit man. I love it when you do shit like that like when you slice the celery from some chick’s mouth and she doesn’t even flinch or nothing like that?</p>
<p>The real dilm ladies.
Won’t the real dilm ladies please stand up.
Please stand up.
Please stand up.</p>
<h2>Slimey Dilm</h2>
<p>Dilm. Does it sound too close to “MILF” or “DILF”? Or does it sound a sound of “DILK,” or “PILK.”</p>
<p>Welcome to your own personal Hell.</p>
<p>“Meet the last surviving Dilm developer in Arkansas. His name is Trailhead Lobe, and here’s what he had to say about the dying practise of developing DILM as one of the last professional DILM developers in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoke-on-Trent">Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire</a>”</p>
<p>“THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING DILM IS ACTUALLY VERY SIMPLE EVERYONE. I’M NOT SURE YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND IT! Y’SEE IT’S BASICALLY THREE DIFFERENT MECHANISMS. THE SLOP THE GLOP AND THE DROP. AND THAT’S ABOUT IT - ONCE YOU GET PAST THE SLOP IT’S ALL GLOP FROM THERE, AND DROP? YEAH, IT’S A PIECE OF CAKE.”</p>
<p>“We spent a day with Trailhead to see just how much slop DILM really takes. What makes DILM tick. Yeah that’s it, keep that last one---”</p>
<p>“I JUST FLIPPED THE DILM RELEASE VALVE. THIS WILL SET THE ROLE INTO EVACUATION MODE. WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT WE’VE GOT ABOUT SEVEN TO NINE MINUTES BEFORE THE ‘DROP,’ IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. IT’S GONNA COME OUT AND IT’S GONNA BE ALL OVER - SO WE’D BETTER GET TO THE BACK OF THE GARAGE.”</p>
<p>“It’s six minutes later and OH! Wow, okay. Okay he wasn’t gahh - he wasn’t kidding and it’s all over my shoes. Okay, that’ perfect… Excuse me, Mr. Trailhead, do you happen to have a towel or hose or some--”</p>
<p>“AAAND THAT’S A FRESH BATCH. YEAH THAT’S GOOD RIGHT THERE. GOOOOD. YEAH LOOKATTHIS LOOKATTHIS---”</p>
<p>“Wow this is really clear! It’s amazing, I mean it’s like I’m actually standing there. The picture from the DILM looks so clear! I mean, I’m really convinced! There you have it folks! DILM really is the future! Nah, I’m just jokin’ around it’s covered in slop it’s covered in slime. I can’t see shit. I really can’t I just don’t have it.”</p>
<p>“I TOLD YOU! WHEEEELLEEE.”
RELEASE the roll from the camera’s capture mechanism.</p>
<p>Probably an interesting process, like what with the dilm and the developing maybe you eat it or there’s slime</p>
<p>“So essentially It's a crazy process. What about the dilm camera? Does it have some sort of a chemical tank that lets you put in the different chemicals?”</p>
<p>“IT HAS A TANK ON THE SIDE AND YOU HAVE TO FILL IT UP WITH THE RIGHT CHEMICALS AND THEN IT GOES THROUGH THE TUBES AND WHEN YOU TAKE A PICTURE OR WIND THE FILM THE LIQUID KIND OF SLOSHES AROUND.”</p>
<p>I think the form factor should be that of a large military camera that is really interesting.</p>
<p>This could also easily be an installation in which participants experience developing dilm on their own! The only thing is that I’m not sure how to achieve the magic of dilm development, since people are very smart actually they might know it’s a trick when they can see the pre-taken pictures on a roll of dilm that has yet to be fully developed. So somehow we’d have to get their actual pictures out into a dilm roll.</p>
<p>Yeah he’s an eccentric guy that does this weird and rare profession - starting out with him at his home, some cool shot of the outdide then cutting to the inside as we hear narration”meet the last Dilm developer in Arkansas”</p>
<p>“Oh thats a sloppy one”</p>
<p>“Lemme show you the tanks, we got bessie and old crummy here and these beauties doe all the work isnt that roght”</p>
<p>“The sound of it breaking and going catastrophically wrong like its about to catch fire is the same as when its working”</p>
<p>“So how do you know if it’s going to explode?”</p>
<p>Oh shit it’s gonna blow! Wait no, thats my hot pocket.</p>
<p>Dilm photos of the film crew that came in then its really creepy photos.</p>
<p>How is this stupid thing still around? Patronage of a wealthy client that turns out to be someone’s mom or something.</p>
